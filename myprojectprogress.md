# Project Ideas
I am open to a lot of project ideas. The only preference I have is that the app uses react and typescript or some sort of backend dotnet project. I don't enjoy using python all that much so I would like to avoid it. I'm open to using GO or Dart, or any new language I haven't already learned.

I think the project design should be a common repository with pull requests and branching. I don't really like the idea of a Blessed repository.
